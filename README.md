# Unit selection TTS toy example in Python

This a toy example and a very simplified way of building a unit selection synthesizer with Python (adapted to Python3). 

This repository is used in my Medium article: https://medium.com/@pilarsoledad/construyendo-un-sintetizador-de-texto-a-voz-usando-python-y-selecci%C3%B3n-de-unidades-a5dc2e11a091
The article is only in Spanish, but it basically shows how to use these scripts to build a toy unit selection voice in Spanish.
