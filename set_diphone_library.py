        Description:
            This method creates the attributes for a diphone object using as source
            a Praat TextGrid file. Reading two lines at the time, each one with a phone,
            we build the diphones by taking the middle time of the current phone and
            the middle time of next one. We don't really "build" the diphones at this stage,
            we just store their identity and where they are (the starting, end times and file)
            into a dictionary where they are sorted by diphone identity, and each one has a list
            of all the examples found in the data for that diphone
        Input:
            filename(str): string with the path of the wave file where the diphone is
            c_lines(str): is the current line in the textGrid being read, which corresponds to the current phone
            n_line(str): is the next line in the textGrid to the one being read, which corresponds to the next phone
        Output:
            a list of phones and stress assignment for the input text
